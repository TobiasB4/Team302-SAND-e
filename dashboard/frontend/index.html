                            Currently, waste in the marine ecosystem is one of the largest global environmental issues. There are many beach cleaning efforts with a focus on mass collection of larger visible garbage. 
                            However, small waste is typically hidden beneath the sand and more difficult to identify. 
                            <br><br>Our stakeholders: Vancouverâ€™s Board of Parks and Recreation, AMS Sustainability, and UBC IGEN have all helped to shape the direction of our project.

                            Project SAND-e tackles the problem of small litter, focusing on collecting waste such as caps, cigarette butts, and other trash that is difficult to identify.
                            As an autonomous solution, SAND-e enhances the work of current cleaning crews by providing a more thorough cleansing of the beach.
                            To this end, we have created a beach crawling rover aided by GPS and an pre-generated path to sieve up to 95% of an area for small waste.
